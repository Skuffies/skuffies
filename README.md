## What I code
Most of my repositories are freelance related and are therefore private. A lot of my work has been Discord bots and almost all of my work has been NodeJS related. I'm learning C# in school at the moment and I'm also trying to find time to contribute to more open-source projects but at this point I don't really feel like doing it. I experiment a lot and I'm still learning and I'm not looking for job opportunities or anything like that at the moment and I'm just here to be here :)
