## Programming, why?
Programming and software-development has been one of my biggest interests for a long time! It started with trying to make mods and levels for games that I enjoyed playing, and resulted in being my career choice, several years later. While I am still in school, specifically for game development, I do some freelancing on the side! C# is the programming language which I am trying to master in school, but I have known JavaScript for several years now!

## What can I do for you?
I have several projects of freelance of experience. The two programming languages that I am comfortable with are JavaScript and C#. Most of my work is done with JavaScript ande NodeJS, building the back-ends of multiple websites and with fetching the data that is associated with it, feel like that sounds anything like what you need, send an email!
